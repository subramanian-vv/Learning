            <div class="col-lg-1 col-md-1 col-sl-1"> <h3 id="item1"> Chocolate </h3> <p> Chocolate ice cream is generally made by blending cocoa powder along with the eggs, cream, vanilla and sugar used to make vanilla ice cream. Sometimes chocolate liquor is used in addition to cocoa powder to create the chocolate flavor. Cocoa powder gives this its brown color and it is uncommon to add other colorings. </p> </div>
            <div class="col-lg-1 col-md-1 col-sl-1"> <h3 id="item2"> Vanilla </h3> <p> Vanilla ice cream, like other flavors of ice cream, was originally created by cooling a mixture made of cream, sugar, and vanilla above a container of ice and salt. To create the smooth consistency of ice cream, the mixture has to be stirred occasionally and then returned to the container of ice to continue the solidification process. </p> </div>
            <div class="col-lg-1 col-md-2 col-sl-1"> <h3 id="item3"> Butterscotch </h3> <p> Butterscotch ice cream has a delicious butterscotch flavor. This silky and creamy ice cream is loaded with chunky pieces of butterscotch pralines. Butter, sugar, and cashew nuts mingled in this ice cream recipe to build such a deliciously crunchy and smooth butterscotch flavored ice cream. It is amazingly delish, smooth and creamy.  </p> </div>
